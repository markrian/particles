 - Make a particle pool, so that emitters don't just accrue more and more
   particles if they never go off-screen
 - Make things hoverable:
    / Emitters
    / RadialForces
    / ConstantForce
 / Make things draggable:
    / Emitters
    / RadialForces
    / ConstantForce
    / Fix bug where clicking on any item drags it a bit
 / Make things selectable:
    / Emitters
    / RadialForces
    / ConstantForce
    - Add pulsing animation for selected item
 - Add config panels for things:
    / Emitters
    / RadialForces
    / ConstantForce
 - Improve drawings:
    / Arrow for ConstantForce
    - Radial gradiant for RadialForce sucks...
    / ConstantForce arrow head isn't correct for all angles!
 - Make things deletable:
    - From panel:
        / Emitters
        / RadialForces
        / ConstantForce
    - from keyboard:
        - Emitters
        - RadialForces
        - ConstantForce
 - Change Emitter start/end angle to angle and spread
